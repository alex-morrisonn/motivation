### Troubleshooting

**Q: My widgets aren't updating daily**
A: Ensure Background App Refresh is enabled for Moti in your device settings. You can also manually refresh widgets by touching and holding the widget, then choosing "Edit Widget" or removing and re-adding it.

**Q: Why did I lose my streak?**
A: Streaks reset if you don't open the app for more than one day. Make sure to open the app at least once every day to maintain your streak.

**Q: My notifications aren't working**
A: Check that notifications are enabled both in the app (More tab) and in your device Settings. Make sure your device is not in Do Not Disturb mode at your scheduled notification time.

**Q: How do I restore my favorites after reinstalling?**
A: Your favorites are stored locally on your device. Currently, there is no cloud backup system, so favorites cannot be restored after complete app removal.

**Q: How can I clear the app cache?**
A: Go to the More tab and scroll to the bottom. Tap "Clear Cache" to refresh the app data. Note that this won't affect your favorites or streak.
